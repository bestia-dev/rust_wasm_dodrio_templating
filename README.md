My projects on Github are more like a tutorial than a finished product: [bestia-dev tutorials](https://github.com/bestia-dev/tutorials_rust_wasm).

## Html templating

In the past I wrote html inside Rust code with the macro `html!` from the `crate typed-html`  
<https://github.com/bodil/typed-html>  
It has also a macro `dodrio !` created exclusively for the dodrio vdom.  
I had two main problems with this approach:  

1. Any change to the html required a recompiling. And that is very slow in Rust.  
2. I could not add new html elements, that the macro don't recognize. I wanted to use SVG. There was not support for that.  

I reinvented the wheel - "html templating".  
First a graphical designer makes a html/css page that looks nice. No javascript, nothing is dynamic. It is just a graphical template.  
Then I insert in it html comments and "data-" attributes that I can later replace in my code.  
The html is not changed graphically because of it. So both the graphical designer and the programmer are still happy.  
In my code I parse the html template as a microXml file. Basically they are the same with small effort. When I find a comment or "data-" attribute then the value of the next node is replaced.  
I can replace attributes, strings and entire nodes. And I can insert event for behavior with "data-wt".  
When developing, the html template is loaded and parsed and a dodrio node is created. That is not very fast. But I can change the html in real time and see it rendered without compiling the Rust code. This is super efficient for development.  
I have in plans to add a Rust code generator, that creates the Rust code for the dodrio node before compile time. In that case nothing is parsed in runtime and I expect great speeds. But the flexibility of easily changing the html template is gone. For every change I must recompile the Rust code.

## How to use it

Inside a perfectly working static html insert special comments and attributes to replace the next node or attribute.  

### Replace the next text node  

Insert a comment that starts with "wt_" (webbrowser text).  
After that is the name of the enum to replace in the fn replace_with_string().  

```html
<p><!--wt_new_text>old_text</p>
```

### Replace the next node with nodes  

Insert a comment that starts with "wn_" (webbrowser nodes).  
After that is the name of the enum to replace in the fn replace_with_nodes().  
The computed nodes can be complicated with a lot of html. If needed, this fragments of html are saved inside the html template as sub_templates.  

```html
<p><!--wn_new_nodes><div id="old_node">...</div></p>
```

### Replace the next attribute text value  

Insert an attribute that starts with "data-wt-" (webbrowser text).  
The attribute name finishes in the name of the next attribute.  
The attribute value is the enum to use in the fn replace_with_string().  

```html
<input data-wt-value="wt_new_text" value="old text" />
```

### Set the event handler  

Insert an attribute that starts with "data-on-".  
The attribute name finishes in the name of the event to handle.  
The attribute value is the enum to use in the fn set_event_listener().  
The enum name must start with "wl_" (Webbrowser listener).

```html
<input data-on-keyup="wl_nickname_on_keyup" />
```

### Sub_templates

When a part of the html template needs to be repeated, we use sub_templates.
A sub_template is inside the html template in the node `<template>`.  

```html
<template name="sub_template_name">
        <div>some html</div>
</template>
```

The sub_template has a name attribute that is used for replacement in Rust code to return a vector of nodes for replace the "wn_" special comment.  

```ignore
pub fn div_grid_all_items<'a>(
    rrc: &RootRenderingComponent,
    cx: &mut RenderContext<'a>,
) -> Vec<Node<'a>> {
    let mut vec_grid_items: Vec<Node<'a>> = Vec::new();
    for x in 1..=10 {
        let html_template = rrc.web_data.get_sub_template("sub_template_name");

        let grid_item = rrc.render_template(
            cx,
            &html_template,
            rust_wasm_dodrio_templating::html_template_mod::HtmlOrSvg::Html
        ).unwrap();
        vec_grid_items.push(grid_item_bump);
    }

    // return
    vec_grid_items
}
```
